<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Carlos and I am a web developer.
</p>
<p>
  I was born in Spain and i have always been a huge fan of technology and videogames. Grew up playing with mi dad's old Super Nintendo and fell in love with videogames.
  Always dreamed about creating my own videogame all by myself one of a kind. My job took me to Ireland where i met many foreigners i can call friends nowadays. It was there where I found the motivation i was lacking. I started practicing boxing and immediatly fell in love with contact sports.
  Boxing told me about discipline hard work and motivated me to be my best version every day. Made many friends along the way who helped me grow and improve every day. As a big fan of anime and japanese culture my dream is to be able to live in Japan some day and learn more abut their culture and tradition.
</p>
<p>I really enjoyed playing videogames and beating new challenges. In order to achieve my goal of creating my own videogame y decided to study a Computer Science degree.
  I really enjoyed every challenge i had during my career, but this challenges helped me realize how complex is the development task and how many people (and money) takes to do things the right way. 
Then i learnt more about webapps and web development. Since i knew about it I have been always studying and learning trying to keep myself updated. I have been working for 8 years in positions related to web apps (from development to Support solving any kind of issues).</p>
